# BuildCity

Hey there! BuildCity is a mobile pocket edition minecraft server. Build and founded in 2019 it was created so that I could show and build cool idesa and show my friends. But now we are making it into a full survival minecraft server that has built in anti grief and automatic ore regeneration and tree regen so that you will never run out of resources!

You ->> Regen: I mined the tree/ore
Regen ->> Server: Replace the tree/ore
Server ->> Regen: Randomly spawn the tree/ore 
Regen ->> You: Make sure user is not within 30 block of respawing trees/ores
Note right of Server: This is a new feature <br> and will be fixed <br> over time for errors
